# cardano-spo-setup
Abbreviated steps to setting up stakepool using https://demeter.run

Aim is to record commands that are loaded on workspace creation and can be used to step through stake pool creation.

This is not to be used for production, it is only for concepts around introductory setting up a Cardano stake pool in a simplified manner.  It does not respect full and secure processes required for production nodes.
